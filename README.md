# Map visualization using Dijkstra's algorithm | Internal Project

Roads play a Major role to the people live in various states, cities, town and villages, from each and every day they travel to work, to schools, to business meetings, and to transport their goods. Even in this modern era whole world used roads, remain one of the most useful mediums used most frequently for transportation and travel. The manipulation of shortest paths between various locations appears to be a major problem in the road networks. The large range of applications and product was introduced to solve or overcome the difficulties by developing different shortest path algorithms. Even now the problem still exists to find the shortest path for road networks. Shortest Path problems are inevitable in road network applications such as city emergency handling and drive guiding system. Basic concepts of network analysis in connection with traffic issues are explored. The traffic condition among a city changes from time to time and there are usually huge amounts of requests occur, it needs to find the solution quickly. The above problems can be rectified through shortest paths by using the Dijkstra’s Algorithm. The whole project is designed in ‘C++’ language and different variables and strings have been used for the development of this project. The design is so simple that user should not find it difficult to use and navigate.  

### Objectives: 
1.Low cost of the implementation.   
2.The shortest path problem is to find a path between two vertices (nodes) on a given graph, such that the sum of the weights on its constituent edges is minimized.   
3.The classic Dijkstra’s algorithm was designed to solve the single source shortest path problem for a static graph. 

### Concepts Used:
1. Object Oriented Programming:

       i. Class and objects
       ii.
2. Data Structure and Algorithms:
